# ProcessWire 3.x Default Site Profile

## Direct output / beginner version

The default site profile comes in 3 different versions: beginner, intermediate, and 
multi-language. The truth is, they are all equally simple (and all for beginners), 
but we are anxious to get you working with ProcessWire as quickly and easily as 
possible, so wanted to show you a couple different ways of doing things. We've 
found that some people just getting started with ProcessWire may be more likely 
to catch on quickly with the beginner version of the default site profile. Not 
because it's necessarily simpler, but because it uses a strategy similar to what 
you may have used elsewhere, called direct output.

## To install

Depending on your version of ProcessWire, you may already have this site profile
included with the core, in which case you do not need to download it. If you find
that you do not already have it, follow the instructions below: 

- To use this site profile, you must first have a copy of ProcessWire that has 
  not yet gone through the installation process. 

- Copy the files from this repository into a `/site-beginner/` directory in your
  web root (or wherever ProcessWireâ€™s `install.php` file is located). 

- Open the URL where you've copied ProcessWire's files to in your web browser. 
  The installer should start, and when it asks you what site profile you want to
  install, you should see this profile there. Select it and continue installation.
